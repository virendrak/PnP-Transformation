      <![CDATA[Summary view is a holistic & consolidated view for all the web application which will provide the information about the totals of  the customization usage stored in a bunch of independent Discovery Usage reports. Summary view will facilitate to take a decision which web application and customization need to transform first based on the complexity and business need. You would not need to open each individual usage reports to analyze the data. Some time Discovery Usage reports can often contain large amounts of data which itself would also be a tedious work to analyze the data.
      Summary View Report is divided into two section:
      a.	Web Application View – This is a tabular kind of view which will provide the information of each component count against each web application.
      b.	Chart View: Chart view is a kind of Pie Chart Distribution which will provide the distribution view of each component across all the web application.]]>
